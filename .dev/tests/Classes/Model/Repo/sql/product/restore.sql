But unlike most hand warmers, this one you can use over and over again. And, you don\'t have to pop it in the microwave to heat up.</p>\n<p>The magic with the heart hand warmer is in the metal disc you see inside it. All you do is click the disc back and forth a few times and you\'ll see the clearish gel inside become opaque. As the opaqueness spreads, so does the heat! It\'s a crazy chemical reaction which we like to call AWESOME! Seriously, the pretty red gel is a supersaturated solution. Bending the disc starts an exothermic crystallization of the gel (i.e. it goes opaque and gets hot). And when it loses its warmth, all you have to do is wrap it in a towel and throw it into boiling water for about 15-20 minutes and the Heart Hand Warmer resets itself. Once it cools off from its boiling bath, it is ready to be used again. A great, fun way to keep your fingers warm this winter. Got a chilly butt? Then slip it in your back pocket.

So go ahead, enjoy the fruits of our helicopter obsession... we don\'t mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Precise Control</strong><br />The secret of the incredible stability of the Dark Blade 3-Channel R/C Helicopter comes down to the torque control afforded by the dual rotor design. A traditional helicopter with only one rotor generates massive torque when the top blade spins. Normally this would cause the copter to spin out of control, but the rotor on the tail is designed to offset this torque. Therefore piloting a traditional helicopter involves constantly adjusting the tail speed whenever you increase the speed of the top rotor... difficult and time consuming to learn. The Dark Blade 3-Channel R/C Helicopter has dual rotors on the top which spin in opposite directions. These opposite spinning blades cancel out uncontrolled torque making for incredibly stable flight. For forward and reverse motion the tail rotor then blows up or down, pitching the copter forward or backward and causing it to move in that direction. It\'s a great control system and a pleasure to fly.</p>\n<p><strong>Innovative Forward Propulsion System</strong><br />If you look carefully at the Dark Blade, you\'ll see two small side propellers that would appear to push the copter forward. Actually these side propellers are purely cosmetic. All the forward action happens with the small rear propeller hidden <em>beneath</em> the tail. This propeller then spins to pitch the Dark Blade copter forward or backward. In most small 3-Channel R/C copters the rear propeller needs to be mounted at some distance from the top rotors to get enough leverage to pitch the copter, this forces the helicopter design to be longer. However, the tail above the rear rotor in the Dark Blade acts to magnify the thrust of the propeller and allows a more compact 3-channel design.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<object width=\"300\" height=\"247\" data=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/wP9NwryiDPc\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\">\n<param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/wP9NwryiDPc\" />\n</object>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h6>Product Features</h6>\n<ul>\n<li>Easiest to fly, most precise controlling R/C copter yet </li>\n<li>Three channel control gives you fully proportional up/down, right/left and forward/backward control </li>\n<li>Amazing mini size for a 3-channel helicopter </li>\n<li>Futuristic drop-ship style design </li>\n<li>Sleek black plastic body.

As standard procedure, the offending parties are teleported to the surface of Vulcan where they duel to the death to resolve their differences. However due to the high employee turnover rate we have revised the policy to declare a victor based on Palmzsize Battle Tank warfare. These detailed diminutive r/c tanks feature authentic tank sounds and IR based \"laser tag\" action with realistic recoil. A hit momentarily disables your opponent. Get enough hits and take control of your enemy\'s tank. Each set contains two-tanks, but buy an extra set and up to four tanks can battle at once to solve those more complicated office disagreements.</p>\n<p><strong>Important Note:</strong><br />We know you read directions... but just in case you don\'t, please realize that each tank can be set to any of four channels.

FRAK!</h5>\n<p>History lesson, boys and girls; everyone take their seats. In 1539, people were bored and poor. One day, Filius Giles of North Southwesteasternshire thought of a great way to pass the time. He took a chunk of lead (called a \"pohtaytoh\" by blacksmiths of the time) and heated it up. Gathering some friends, he dipped the pohtaytoh in lard with his tongs and threw it to his closest friend. The lard began melting away as each person threw it to another, hoping not to get burned by the \"hot pohtaytoh.\" Apparently, everyone had a blast, and the game has survived today.</p>\n<p>And now Hot Pohtaytoh has evolved into the Shock Ball. The Shock Ball plays just like the classic game - with one major alteration. This ball doesn\'t want you to win. It wants you to drop it and lose. And to get you to drop it, the Shock Ball (as you probably have guessed) shoots out random electrical shocks (and lights up to make the experience more enjoyable).

Neff</h5>\n<p>What does it really take to run a successful company today? Thomas Neff and James Citrin, U.S. chairman and managing director, respectively, of the Spencer Stuart executive-search firm, offer revealing answers in <em>Lessons from the Top: The Search for America\'s Best Business Leaders</em>. In 50 short but perceptive profiles, they identify and analyze the men and women who drive today\'s most successful corporations. As might be expected, the authors lean heavily on well-known CEOs such as Steve Case of America Online, Michael Dell of Dell Computer, and Howard Schultz of Starbucks. But they also look at a number who don\'t get the same publicity, including Fannie Mae\'s Frank Raines, the Gap\'s Don Fisher, and Autodesk\'s Carol Bartz. The result is a broad but surprisingly consistent palette of personalities and philosophies that in a concluding section Neff and Citrin highlight by synthesizing into 10 common traits (passion, intelligence, communication skill, high energy, controlled ego, inner peace, a defining background, strong family life, positive attitude, and a focus on \"doing the right things right\") and six core principles (live with integrity, develop a winning strategy, build a great management team, inspire employees, create a flexible organization, and implement relevant systems). This book is for managers and anyone else looking for the patterns of success, both in and out of business. <em>--Howard Rothman</em> <em>--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.</em></p>\n<p><strong>From Publishers Weekly</strong><br />Headhunters Neff and Citrin of Spencer Stuart U.S. set out systematically to identify, profile, interview and capture the vision of the nation\'s top 50 CEOs. Through their company, they commissioned Gallup polls, gathered performance data and constructed a list of intangibles (\"showed the ability to overcome challenges,\" \"demonstrated consistent strength of character,\" etc.). The final results don\'t look all that different on the surface from countless other books purporting to offer the managerial motherlode, but in this case the difference is in the details. Interviews with AT&amp;T\'s Mike Armstrong, Charles Schwab, Martha Ingram (one of four women named), Louis Gerstner, Bill Gates and Bill Marriott are all illuminating, revealing complementary aspects of captaining the ship without making redundant observations. A few of the notions even seem worker-centered: Starbucks\' Howard Schultz points to the decision to provide equity and stock options to employees, even part-timers, as one of the main reasons why his company\'s attrition rate is below 60% annually (compared with the national average of 250%). The book is filled with such ideas, presented with a minimum of self-promotion from their purveyors. A final section of \"lessons learned\" offers a \"new definition of success\" that begins \"live with integrity and lead by example.\" As concise and clear a management guide as readers are likely to find, this is a great tip sheet on business leadership.

Google is the world&rsquo;s largest and most powerful search engine. In other words, it&rsquo;s an incredible tool that allows you to locate a wide array of information on the Internet including websites, news, maps, phone numbers, stock quotes and much, much more.</p>\n<p>Google is important it is our gateway to access information online. Every day more information is available electronically and we continue to discover new reasons to need access to that information. In fact, many people are finding themselves accessing Google 10, 20 or even 100 times a day. So given the usefulness of Google and the increasing importance of Google in our lives, you would expect users to understand how to use Google and all of its services. Unfortunately, the opposite is true.</p>\n<p>Most Google users only know how to perform basic Google searches and are actually quite inefficient in these efforts. As a result, most users are wasting their time, energy and money. This book is designed for beginner to intermediate level Google users who want to be more productive with Google. We will begin with an overview of how to maximize Basic Search, and then progress through advanced techniques, other types of search, and information on other Google services. Lastly we will reveal some Google hacks and tricks for more expert users.</p>\n<h6>About the Author</h6>\n<p>TOD SACERDOTI is an author, entrepreneur and self-proclaimed Google addict.

HBR OnPoint articles save you time by enhancing an original Harvard Business Review article with an overview that draws out the main points and an annotated bibliography that points you to related resources. This enables you to scan, absorb, and share the management insights with others. We all know that leaders need vision and energy, but after an exhaustive review of the most influential theories on leadership--as well as workshops with thousands of leaders and aspiring leaders--the authors learned that great leaders also share four unexpected qualities: 1) They selectively reveal their weaknesses; 2) They rely heavily on intuition to gauge the appropriate timing and course of their actions; 3) They manage employees with \"tough empathy\"; and 4) They capitalize on their differences. All four qualities are necessary for inspirational leadership, but they cannot be used mechanically; they must be mixed and matched to meet the demands of particular situations. Most important, however, is that the qualities encourage authenticity among leaders. To be a true leader, the authors advise, \"Be yourself--more--with skill.\"</p>\n<h6>About the Author</h6>\n<p>Rob Goffee is Professor of Organizational Behavior at London Business School.

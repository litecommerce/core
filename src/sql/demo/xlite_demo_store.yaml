Well, to celebrate the joys of being a vampire and to help keep your hands warm this winter, we bring you the perfectly named Heart Hand Warmer. But unlike most hand warmers, this one you can use over and over again. And, you don''t have to pop it in the microwave to heat up.</p>n<p>The magic with the heart hand warmer is in the metal disc you see inside it. All you do is click the disc back and forth a few times and you''ll see the clearish gel inside become opaque. As the opaqueness spreads, so does the heat! It''s a crazy chemical reaction which we like to call AWESOME! Seriously, the pretty red gel is a supersaturated solution. Bending the disc starts an exothermic crystallization of the gel (i.e. it goes opaque and gets hot). And when it loses its warmth, all you have to do is wrap it in a towel and throw it into boiling water for about 15-20 minutes and the Heart Hand Warmer resets itself. Once it cools off from its boiling bath, it is ready to be used again. A great, fun way to keep your fingers warm this winter. Got a chilly butt? Then slip it in your back pocket.

Created by ThinkGeek</h5>n<p>Here at ThinkGeek it seems like no matter how many little R/C helicopters we fly, we''re always looking for a new high with the next greatest model. Which is why we decided to kick the vicious copter cycle and go ahead and create the perfect micro indoor helicopter. The Dark Blade 3-Channel R/C Helicopter is an original ThinkGeek creation combining a futuristic drop-ship style design with precise flying characteristics and an innovative rear propeller system. Plus it just happens to be the smallest 3-channel R/C copter we''ve ever seen. So go ahead, enjoy the fruits of our helicopter obsession... we don''t mind.</p>n<p><strong>Precise Control</strong><br />The secret of the incredible stability of the Dark Blade 3-Channel R/C Helicopter comes down to the torque control afforded by the dual rotor design. A traditional helicopter with only one rotor generates massive torque when the top blade spins. Normally this would cause the copter to spin out of control, but the rotor on the tail is designed to offset this torque. Therefore piloting a traditional helicopter involves constantly adjusting the tail speed whenever you increase the speed of the top rotor... difficult and time consuming to learn. The Dark Blade 3-Channel R/C Helicopter has dual rotors on the top which spin in opposite directions. These opposite spinning blades cancel out uncontrolled torque making for incredibly stable flight. For forward and reverse motion the tail rotor then blows up or down, pitching the copter forward or backward and causing it to move in that direction. It''s a great control system and a pleasure to fly.</p>n<p><strong>Innovative Forward Propulsion System</strong><br />If you look carefully at the Dark Blade, you''ll see two small side propellers that would appear to push the copter forward. Actually these side propellers are purely cosmetic. All the forward action happens with the small rear propeller hidden <em>beneath</em> the tail. This propeller then spins to pitch the Dark Blade copter forward or backward. In most small 3-Channel R/C copters the rear propeller needs to be mounted at some distance from the top rotors to get enough leverage to pitch the copter, this forces the helicopter design to be longer. However, the tail above the rear rotor in the Dark Blade acts to magnify the thrust of the propeller and allows a more compact 3-channel design.</p>n<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">n<tbody>n<tr>n<td>n<object width="300" height="247" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/wP9NwryiDPc" type="application/x-shockwave-flash">n<param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/wP9NwryiDPc" />n</object>n</td>n</tr>n</tbody>n</table>n<p>&nbsp;</p>n<h6>Product Features</h6>n<ul>n<li>Easiest to fly, most precise controlling R/C copter yet </li>n<li>Three channel control gives you fully proportional up/down, right/left and forward/backward control </li>n<li>Amazing mini size for a 3-channel helicopter </li>n<li>Futuristic drop-ship style design </li>n<li>Sleek black plastic body.

FRAK!</h5>n<p>History lesson, boys and girls; everyone take their seats. In 1539, people were bored and poor. One day, Filius Giles of North Southwesteasternshire thought of a great way to pass the time. He took a chunk of lead (called a "pohtaytoh" by blacksmiths of the time) and heated it up. Gathering some friends, he dipped the pohtaytoh in lard with his tongs and threw it to his closest friend. The lard began melting away as each person threw it to another, hoping not to get burned by the "hot pohtaytoh." Apparently, everyone had a blast, and the game has survived today.</p>n<p>And now Hot Pohtaytoh has evolved into the Shock Ball. The Shock Ball plays just like the classic game - with one major alteration. This ball doesn''t want you to win. It wants you to drop it and lose. And to get you to drop it, the Shock Ball (as you probably have guessed) shoots out random electrical shocks (and lights up to make the experience more enjoyable). If you can hold onto the Shock Ball, you will quickly become the Shock Ball Champ. And everyone will know you have nerves of steel and a very unique hairstyle (you know, from all the shocks). Shocking fun for everyone.</p>n<p>The Shock Ball is approx. 2.5" in diameter,has an auto off function (for a modicum of safety), and uses 2 AAA batteries (not included).</p>n<p><strong>Warning: The Product Emits An Electric Shock.

Neff</h5>n<p>What does it really take to run a successful company today? Thomas Neff and James Citrin, U.S. chairman and managing director, respectively, of the Spencer Stuart executive-search firm, offer revealing answers in <em>Lessons from the Top: The Search for America''s Best Business Leaders</em>. In 50 short but perceptive profiles, they identify and analyze the men and women who drive today''s most successful corporations. As might be expected, the authors lean heavily on well-known CEOs such as Steve Case of America Online, Michael Dell of Dell Computer, and Howard Schultz of Starbucks. But they also look at a number who don''t get the same publicity, including Fannie Mae''s Frank Raines, the Gap''s Don Fisher, and Autodesk''s Carol Bartz. The result is a broad but surprisingly consistent palette of personalities and philosophies that in a concluding section Neff and Citrin highlight by synthesizing into 10 common traits (passion, intelligence, communication skill, high energy, controlled ego, inner peace, a defining background, strong family life, positive attitude, and a focus on "doing the right things right") and six core principles (live with integrity, develop a winning strategy, build a great management team, inspire employees, create a flexible organization, and implement relevant systems). This book is for managers and anyone else looking for the patterns of success, both in and out of business. <em>--Howard Rothman</em> <em>--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.</em></p>n<p><strong>From Publishers Weekly</strong><br />Headhunters Neff and Citrin of Spencer Stuart U.S. set out systematically to identify, profile, interview and capture the vision of the nation''s top 50 CEOs. Through their company, they commissioned Gallup polls, gathered performance data and constructed a list of intangibles ("showed the ability to overcome challenges," "demonstrated consistent strength of character," etc.). The final results don''t look all that different on the surface from countless other books purporting to offer the managerial motherlode, but in this case the difference is in the details. Interviews with AT&amp;T''s Mike Armstrong, Charles Schwab, Martha Ingram (one of four women named), Louis Gerstner, Bill Gates and Bill Marriott are all illuminating, revealing complementary aspects of captaining the ship without making redundant observations. A few of the notions even seem worker-centered: Starbucks'' Howard Schultz points to the decision to provide equity and stock options to employees, even part-timers, as one of the main reasons why his company''s attrition rate is below 60% annually (compared with the national average of 250%). The book is filled with such ideas, presented with a minimum of self-promotion from their purveyors. A final section of "lessons learned" offers a "new definition of success" that begins "live with integrity and lead by example." As concise and clear a management guide as readers are likely to find, this is a great tip sheet on business leadership.

HBR OnPoint articles save you time by enhancing an original Harvard Business Review article with an overview that draws out the main points and an annotated bibliography that points you to related resources. This enables you to scan, absorb, and share the management insights with others. We all know that leaders need vision and energy, but after an exhaustive review of the most influential theories on leadership--as well as workshops with thousands of leaders and aspiring leaders--the authors learned that great leaders also share four unexpected qualities: 1) They selectively reveal their weaknesses; 2) They rely heavily on intuition to gauge the appropriate timing and course of their actions; 3) They manage employees with "tough empathy"; and 4) They capitalize on their differences. All four qualities are necessary for inspirational leadership, but they cannot be used mechanically; they must be mixed and matched to meet the demands of particular situations. Most important, however, is that the qualities encourage authenticity among leaders. To be a true leader, the authors advise, "Be yourself--more--with skill."</p>n<h6>About the Author</h6>n<p>Rob Goffee is Professor of Organizational Behavior at London Business School.

View a list of turn-by-turn directions, or see a highlighted map route. You also can mark specific locations and find the best route between them.</p>n<p><strong>Enjoy the View</strong><br />Just like Google Maps on your computer, Maps on iPod touch lets you switch between views of Google map data, satellite images, and a hybrid of both. Multi-Touch makes the difference.

Email a photo to a friend, set it as your wallpaper, or share it in a MobileMe Gallery.</p>n<p><strong>Save Photos</strong><br />If you receive a great image in an email, save it to your photo library on iPod touch. Once there, it acts just like any other photo. You can set it as your wallpaper, share it on the web, or pass it on.</p>n<p><strong>Sync Photos</strong><br />iPod touch uses iTunes to sync photos you have in iPhoto on a Mac or Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Photoshop Album on a PC. Just choose which photos or albums to sync to your iPod touch, then you can look at them--and share them--anywhere you go.</p>n<p><img src="http://app.ecwid.com/image/5652?ownerid=1003" border="0" alt="" /></p>n<h6>Calendar</h6>n<p>With iPod touch, it''s easy to make plans and stay on schedule.</p>n<p><strong>Add Events</strong><br />Keep your schedule at your fingertips with iPod touch.

And Month view offers an at-a-glance look at an entire month.</p>n<h6>Contacts</h6>n<p>Put names, email addresses, phone numbers, and more at your fingertips.</p>n<p><img src="http://app.ecwid.com/image/5653?ownerid=1003" border="0" alt="" /></p>n<p><strong>Make Contact</strong><br />Build your contacts list on your Mac with Address Book or on your PC with Microsoft Outlook, then sync everything to your iPod touch using iTunes.

Or you can scroll up and down your entire list to find the right contact. Want to send them an email? Just tap an email address and the Mail application opens automatically.</p>n<p><strong>Organized by Groups</strong><br />If you keep your contacts organized into groups--such as co-workers, friends, family, and so on--iPod touch will, too. And iPod touch can hold more than just names, email addresses, and phone numbers. You also can track birthdays, websites, nicknames, and notes.</p>n<h6>Stocks, Weather, and Notes</h6>n<p>Stay on top of it all.</p>n<p><strong>Check Stocks</strong><br />Stocks on iPod touch shows you performance information for any stock you choose.

There''s even a built-in email function that lets you send notes to yourself or others.</p>n<h6>Calculator</h6>n<p>iPod touch''s calculator helps you settle the restaurant bill or keep track of your budget.</p>n<p><strong>Calculate Simply</strong><br />When you tap the Calculator icon, iPod touch shows you a simple application with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and memory functions. Use it just as you would a pocket calculator.</p>n<p><strong>Calculate Scientifically</strong><br />Your simple calculator doubles as a sophisticated scientific calculator. Just rotate it to landscape to access dozens of functions for solving complex science and math problems.</p>n<p><img src="http://app.ecwid.com/image/5654?ownerid=1003" border="0" alt="" /></p>n<h6>Nike + iPod</h6>n<p>Get the most out of your workout.</p>n<p><strong>Tune Your Run</strong><br />iPod touch now includes built-in Nike + iPod support. Just slip the Nike + iPod Sensor (available separately) into your Nike+ shoe and start your run. The sensor communicates wirelessly with your iPod touch, tracking your time, distance, and calories burned. It even gives you voice feedback on your progress.</p>n<p><strong>Tune Your Cardio Workout</strong><br />This feature also works with new cardio equipment available in many fitness centers. Just look for treadmills, ellipticals, stair steppers, and stationary bikes that are Nike + iPod compatible.</p>n<p><strong>Sync with Nikeplus.com</strong><br />When you get back to your computer, sync your iPod touch via iTunes and transfer your exercise data to nikeplus.com, where you can track your workouts, set goals, and challenge friends.</p>n<h6>Multi-Touch</h6>n<p>iPod touch features the same revolutionary interface as iPhone.</p>n<p><strong>Glide, Flick, Pinch</strong><br />Built to take full advantage of the large 3.5-inch display, the Multi-Touch touchscreen interface lets you control everything using only your fingers. So you can glide through albums with Cover Flow, flick through photos and enlarge them with a pinch, zoom in and out on a section of a web page, and control game elements precisely.</p>n<p><strong>How it Works</strong><br />The Multi-Touch display layers a protective shield over a capacitive panel that senses your touch using electrical fields. It then transmits that information to the LCD screen below it. iPod touch software enables the flick, tap, and pinch.</p>n<p><strong>Type with the Touchscreen Keyboard</strong><br />iPod touch features an intelligent touchscreen keyboard perfect for browsing the web in Safari, getting directions on a map, searching for videos on YouTube, finding music on the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store, or adding new contacts. It analyzes keystrokes to suggest words as you type and correct spelling errors automatically. And because it''s software based, it changes its keys to support typing in multiple languages.</p>n<h6>Accelerometer</h6>n<p>iPod touch responds to motion using a built-in accelerometer.</p>n<p><strong>Responds to Movement</strong><br />iPod touch detects when you rotate it from portrait to landscape, then automatically changes the contents of the display. So you immediately see the entire width of a web page, view a photo in its proper aspect ratio, or control a game using only your movements.</p>n<p><strong>How it Works</strong><br />The accelerometer inside iPod touch uses three elements: a silicon mass, a set of silicon springs, and an electrical current. The silicon springs measure the position of the silicon mass using the electrical current. Rotating iPod touch causes a fluctuation in the electrical current passing through the silicon springs. The accelerometer registers these fluctuations and tells iPod touch to adjust the display accordingly.</p>n<p><strong>Perfect for Gaming</strong><br />Accelerometer technology really shines when you play games because it immerses you in the action. It''s perfect for racing games--where your entire iPod touch acts as a steering wheel--and for tap-and-tilt games like Super Monkey Ball, in which your character responds to your every movement.</p>n<h6>Wireless</h6>n<p>Connect iPod touch to the Internet anywhere there''s a wireless network.</p>n<p><strong>Connect Automatically</strong><br />iPod touch locates nearby wireless hotspots, including protected networks. If you''ve never used a particular network, it asks you to enter a password the first time, and it remembers the password from then on. So the next time you''re within range, it connects automatically.</p>n<p><strong>Surf''s Up</strong><br />Now you can send email from a coffee shop. Surf the web at the airport. Shop for games from your couch. Browse, buy, and download music from the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store at select Starbucks locations or other wireless hotspots in your area.</p>n<h6>Read Kindle Books on the iPod touch</h6>n<ul>n<li>No Kindle required. </li>n<li>Get the best reading experience available on your iPhone or iPod touch. </li>n<li>No Kindle required. </li>n<li>Access your Kindle books even if you don''t have your Kindle with you. </li>n<li>Automatically synchronizes your last page read between devices with Amazon Whispersync. </li>n<li>Adjust the text size, add bookmarks, and view the annotations you created on your Kindle. </li>n</ul>n<h6>Shop for Books on the Kindle Store on Your iPod touch</h6>n<ul>n<li>Buy a book from the Kindle Store, optimized for Safari, on your iPod touch or iPhone and get it auto-delivered wirelessly. </li>n<li>Search and browse more than 275', meta_title: '000 of your favorite photos everywhere.</p>n<p><img src="http://app.ecwid.com/image/5651?ownerid=1003" border="0" alt="" /></p>n<p><strong>Share Photos</strong><br />Show thousands of photos from the palm of your hand. Flick to scroll through thumbnails. Tap to view full screen. Rotate to see a photo in landscape. Pinch to zoom in or out. Play slideshows, complete with music and transitions. Email a photo to a friend, set it as your wallpaper, or share it in a MobileMe Gallery.</p>n<p><strong>Save Photos</strong><br />If you receive a great image in an email, save it to your photo library on iPod touch. Once there, it acts just like any other photo. You can set it as your wallpaper, share it on the web, or pass it on.</p>n<p><strong>Sync Photos</strong><br />iPod touch uses iTunes to sync photos you have in iPhoto on a Mac or Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Photoshop Album on a PC. Just choose which photos or albums to sync to your iPod touch, then you can look at them--and share them--anywhere you go.</p>n<p><img src="http://app.ecwid.com/image/5652?ownerid=1003" border="0" alt="" /></p>n<h6>Calendar</h6>n<p>With iPod touch, it''s easy to make plans and stay on schedule.</p>n<p><strong>Add Events</strong><br />Keep your schedule at your fingertips with iPod touch. Add events to your calendar. Set a custom alert. Write a note or two. Manage multiple color-coded calendars. And do it all with just a few taps.</p>n<p><strong>Stay in Sync</strong><br />Connect iPod touch to your computer, and the events that you''ve created on-the-go automatically sync to Microsoft Outlook on a PC or iCal on a Mac. And all the events you''ve added on your computer sync to iPod touch.</p>n<p><strong>Three Ways to View</strong><br />iPod touch gives you three ways to view your calendars. List view shows you all your appointments in the coming days as a comprehensive list, which you can scroll up and down. Day view displays one day''s worth of appointments visually. And Month view offers an at-a-glance look at an entire month.</p>n<h6>Contacts</h6>n<p>Put names, email addresses, phone numbers, and more at your fingertips.</p>n<p><img src="http://app.ecwid.com/image/5653?ownerid=1003" border="0" alt="" /></p>n<p><strong>Make Contact</strong><br />Build your contacts list on your Mac with Address Book or on your PC with Microsoft Outlook, then sync everything to your iPod touch using iTunes. You also can add contact information directly to your iPod touch from maps, web pages, and email. Next time you sync, your computer is updated, too.</p>n<p><strong>Search Contacts</strong><br />If you have a lot of contacts, a quick search shows you a list of matching names. Or you can scroll up and down your entire list to find the right contact. Want to send them an email? Just tap an email address and the Mail application opens automatically.</p>n<p><strong>Organized by Groups</strong><br />If you keep your contacts organized into groups--such as co-workers, friends, family, and so on--iPod touch will, too. And iPod touch can hold more than just names, email addresses, and phone numbers. You also can track birthdays, websites, nicknames, and notes.</p>n<h6>Stocks, Weather, and Notes</h6>n<p>Stay on top of it all.</p>n<p><strong>Check Stocks</strong><br />Stocks on iPod touch shows you performance information for any stock you choose. When you want more details about a stock''s performance, tap the Y! for instant access to Yahoo! Finance.</p>n<p><strong>Get Weather</strong><br />Check worldwide weather at home or away. Add the cities you want, then flick back and forth to get six-day forecasts for each. Tap the Y! to open a Yahoo! city guide that shows you what''s happening, rain or shine.</p>n<p><strong>Take Notes</strong><br />Forget the pen and paper. Use Notes on iPod touch to write yourself a quick note and keep important information on hand. There''s even a built-in email function that lets you send notes to yourself or others.</p>n<h6>Calculator</h6>n<p>iPod touch''s calculator helps you settle the restaurant bill or keep track of your budget.</p>n<p><strong>Calculate Simply</strong><br />When you tap the Calculator icon, iPod touch shows you a simple application with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and memory functions.

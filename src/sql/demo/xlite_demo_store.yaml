That's one of the reasons they drink blood - to keep warm. Well, to celebrate the joys of being a vampire and to help keep your hands warm this winter, we bring you the perfectly named Heart Hand Warmer. But unlike most hand warmers, this one you can use over and over again. And, you don't have to pop it in the microwave to heat up.</p>\n<p>The magic with the heart hand warmer is in the metal disc you see inside it. All you do is click the disc back and forth a few times and you'll see the clearish gel inside become opaque. As the opaqueness spreads, so does the heat! It's a crazy chemical reaction which we like to call AWESOME! Seriously, the pretty red gel is a supersaturated solution. Bending the disc starts an exothermic crystallization of the gel (i.e. it goes opaque and gets hot).

Created by ThinkGeek</h5>\n<p>Here at ThinkGeek it seems like no matter how many little R/C helicopters we fly, we're always looking for a new high with the next greatest model. Which is why we decided to kick the vicious copter cycle and go ahead and create the perfect micro indoor helicopter. The Dark Blade 3-Channel R/C Helicopter is an original ThinkGeek creation combining a futuristic drop-ship style design with precise flying characteristics and an innovative rear propeller system. Plus it just happens to be the smallest 3-channel R/C copter we've ever seen. So go ahead, enjoy the fruits of our helicopter obsession... we don't mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Precise Control</strong><br />The secret of the incredible stability of the Dark Blade 3-Channel R/C Helicopter comes down to the torque control afforded by the dual rotor design. A traditional helicopter with only one rotor generates massive torque when the top blade spins. Normally this would cause the copter to spin out of control, but the rotor on the tail is designed to offset this torque. Therefore piloting a traditional helicopter involves constantly adjusting the tail speed whenever you increase the speed of the top rotor... difficult and time consuming to learn. The Dark Blade 3-Channel R/C Helicopter has dual rotors on the top which spin in opposite directions. These opposite spinning blades cancel out uncontrolled torque making for incredibly stable flight. For forward and reverse motion the tail rotor then blows up or down, pitching the copter forward or backward and causing it to move in that direction. It's a great control system and a pleasure to fly.</p>\n<p><strong>Innovative Forward Propulsion System</strong><br />If you look carefully at the Dark Blade, you'll see two small side propellers that would appear to push the copter forward. Actually these side propellers are purely cosmetic. All the forward action happens with the small rear propeller hidden <em>beneath</em> the tail. This propeller then spins to pitch the Dark Blade copter forward or backward. In most small 3-Channel R/C copters the rear propeller needs to be mounted at some distance from the top rotors to get enough leverage to pitch the copter, this forces the helicopter design to be longer. However, the tail above the rear rotor in the Dark Blade acts to magnify the thrust of the propeller and allows a more compact 3-channel design.</p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<object width=\"300\" height=\"247\" data=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/wP9NwryiDPc\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\">\n<param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/wP9NwryiDPc\" />\n</object>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h6>Product Features</h6>\n<ul>\n<li>Easiest to fly, most precise controlling R/C copter yet </li>\n<li>Three channel control gives you fully proportional up/down, right/left and forward/backward control </li>\n<li>Amazing mini size for a 3-channel helicopter </li>\n<li>Futuristic drop-ship style design </li>\n<li>Sleek black plastic body.

Budapest, Hungary. Erno Rubik, a passionate lecturer and admirer of geometry and 3D forms creates the world's most addictive and perfect puzzle - the Rubik's cube. It's now thirty years later and it's still the best selling puzzle in the Universe.</p>\n<p>If you grew up when the Rubik's cube made it's debut - you probably remember that every kid had one. Whether it was the full size or the keychain version they were as common in school as cell phones and GBAs are these days. Elementary school kids could be seen solving them with their feet on 'That's Incredible!' and conspiracists believed the puzzle was an Eastern block tactic to distract American youth from their educations. In 1980 Cubaholics Anonymous was formally established. The eighties simply enjoyed RubikMania! Here we are in the 21st century and it's still just as addictive as it was thirty years ago.</p>\n<p>Think you can solve it? Think you have what it takes to beat the reigning world record for solving the Rubik's cube? The first world champion was an American high school student who took the Budapest World Championship in 1982 by solving the puzzle in just 22.95 seconds! The latest 2003 winner was Dan Knights of San Francisco who used the 'Fridrich' system to beat the cube in just 20 seconds.

FRAK!</h5>\n<p>History lesson, boys and girls; everyone take their seats. In 1539, people were bored and poor. One day, Filius Giles of North Southwesteasternshire thought of a great way to pass the time. He took a chunk of lead (called a \"pohtaytoh\" by blacksmiths of the time) and heated it up. Gathering some friends, he dipped the pohtaytoh in lard with his tongs and threw it to his closest friend. The lard began melting away as each person threw it to another, hoping not to get burned by the \"hot pohtaytoh.\" Apparently, everyone had a blast, and the game has survived today.</p>\n<p>And now Hot Pohtaytoh has evolved into the Shock Ball.

Neff</h5>\n<p>What does it really take to run a successful company today? Thomas Neff and James Citrin, U.S. chairman and managing director, respectively, of the Spencer Stuart executive-search firm, offer revealing answers in <em>Lessons from the Top: The Search for America's Best Business Leaders</em>. In 50 short but perceptive profiles, they identify and analyze the men and women who drive today's most successful corporations. As might be expected, the authors lean heavily on well-known CEOs such as Steve Case of America Online, Michael Dell of Dell Computer, and Howard Schultz of Starbucks. But they also look at a number who don't get the same publicity, including Fannie Mae's Frank Raines, the Gap's Don Fisher, and Autodesk's Carol Bartz. The result is a broad but surprisingly consistent palette of personalities and philosophies that in a concluding section Neff and Citrin highlight by synthesizing into 10 common traits (passion, intelligence, communication skill, high energy, controlled ego, inner peace, a defining background, strong family life, positive attitude, and a focus on \"doing the right things right\") and six core principles (live with integrity, develop a winning strategy, build a great management team, inspire employees, create a flexible organization, and implement relevant systems). This book is for managers and anyone else looking for the patterns of success, both in and out of business. <em>--Howard Rothman</em> <em>--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.</em></p>\n<p><strong>From Publishers Weekly</strong><br />Headhunters Neff and Citrin of Spencer Stuart U.S. set out systematically to identify, profile, interview and capture the vision of the nation's top 50 CEOs. Through their company, they commissioned Gallup polls, gathered performance data and constructed a list of intangibles (\"showed the ability to overcome challenges,\" \"demonstrated consistent strength of character,\" etc.). The final results don't look all that different on the surface from countless other books purporting to offer the managerial motherlode, but in this case the difference is in the details. Interviews with AT&amp;T's Mike Armstrong, Charles Schwab, Martha Ingram (one of four women named), Louis Gerstner, Bill Gates and Bill Marriott are all illuminating, revealing complementary aspects of captaining the ship without making redundant observations. A few of the notions even seem worker-centered: Starbucks' Howard Schultz points to the decision to provide equity and stock options to employees, even part-timers, as one of the main reasons why his company's attrition rate is below 60% annually (compared with the national average of 250%). The book is filled with such ideas, presented with a minimum of self-promotion from their purveyors. A final section of \"lessons learned\" offers a \"new definition of success\" that begins \"live with integrity and lead by example.\" As concise and clear a management guide as readers are likely to find, this is a great tip sheet on business leadership.

In other words, it&rsquo;s an incredible tool that allows you to locate a wide array of information on the Internet including websites, news, maps, phone numbers, stock quotes and much, much more.</p>\n<p>Google is important it is our gateway to access information online. Every day more information is available electronically and we continue to discover new reasons to need access to that information. In fact, many people are finding themselves accessing Google 10, 20 or even 100 times a day. So given the usefulness of Google and the increasing importance of Google in our lives, you would expect users to understand how to use Google and all of its services. Unfortunately, the opposite is true.</p>\n<p>Most Google users only know how to perform basic Google searches and are actually quite inefficient in these efforts. As a result, most users are wasting their time, energy and money. This book is designed for beginner to intermediate level Google users who want to be more productive with Google. We will begin with an overview of how to maximize Basic Search, and then progress through advanced techniques, other types of search, and information on other Google services. Lastly we will reveal some Google hacks and tricks for more expert users.</p>\n<h6>About the Author</h6>\n<p>TOD SACERDOTI is an author, entrepreneur and self-proclaimed Google addict.

HBR OnPoint articles save you time by enhancing an original Harvard Business Review article with an overview that draws out the main points and an annotated bibliography that points you to related resources. This enables you to scan, absorb, and share the management insights with others. We all know that leaders need vision and energy, but after an exhaustive review of the most influential theories on leadership--as well as workshops with thousands of leaders and aspiring leaders--the authors learned that great leaders also share four unexpected qualities: 1) They selectively reveal their weaknesses; 2) They rely heavily on intuition to gauge the appropriate timing and course of their actions; 3) They manage employees with \"tough empathy\"; and 4) They capitalize on their differences. All four qualities are necessary for inspirational leadership, but they cannot be used mechanically; they must be mixed and matched to meet the demands of particular situations. Most important, however, is that the qualities encourage authenticity among leaders. To be a true leader, the authors advise, \"Be yourself--more--with skill.\"</p>\n<h6>About the Author</h6>\n<p>Rob Goffee is Professor of Organizational Behavior at London Business School.

Stroll into a participating Starbucks, and you're connected automatically.</p>\n<h6>Home Screen</h6>\n<p>Get instant access to whatever you need on your iPod touch.</p>\n<p><strong>Customize Your Home Screen</strong><br />Arrange the icons on your Home screen any way you want. Even move them to another Home screen. Create up to nine Home screens for quick access to the games and applications you download from the App Store and to your Safari Web Clips.</p>\n<p><strong>Go Home</strong><br />No matter where you are on iPod touch, you can press the Home button to return to the Home screen. You can go back to what you were doing at any time.</p>\n<p><strong>Add Apps, Web Clips, and More</strong><br />Whenever you download an application from the App Store, a new icon appears on your Home screen. And if you check the same websites every day, just create Web Clips and you can access the sites directly from your Home screen with a single tap. Not happy with how they're organized? Reorder them any way you want by dragging them around the screen.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://app.ecwid.com/image/5647?ownerid=1003\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h6>Safari</h6>\n<p>iPod touch features Safari, the most advanced web browser ever on a portable device.</p>\n<p><strong>Browse Anywhere</strong><br />The iPod touch is the only iPod with 802.11b/g wireless access to the web. Whenever you're connected via Wi-Fi, you can access your favorite websites to read news, check scores, pay bills, and go shopping.</p>\n<p><strong>Search and Find</strong><br />iPod touch syncs your bookmarks from your PC or Mac, so you can access favorite sites quickly. It has Google and Yahoo! search built in, so it's easy to find what you're looking for on the web.</p>\n<p><strong>Zoom with a View</strong><br />Get a closer look at any web page by zooming in and out with a tap or a pinch of the Multi-Touch display. View websites in portrait or landscape. Rotate iPod touch 90 degrees and the website rotates, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Clip it.</strong><br />If you check a website frequently--a favorite newspaper, blog, or sports site--why not create a Home screen icon for it? Make Web Clips with Safari, and your favorite sites are always just a tap away.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://app.ecwid.com/image/5648?ownerid=1003\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h6>Mail</h6>\n<p>Email on iPod touch looks and works just like email on your computer.</p>\n<p><strong>See it All</strong><br />iPod touch supports rich HTML email, so images and photos appear alongside text. And you see email attachments in their original formats, not stripped-down versions. Rotate, zoom, and pan in more than a dozen standard file and image formats, including PDF; Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint; and iWork.</p>\n<p><strong>Access it All</strong><br />Access your email from popular providers--including MobileMe, Microsoft Exchange, Yahoo! Mail, Google Gmail, and AOL--and most industry-standard IMAP and POP mail systems.</p>\n<p><strong>Send Fast</strong><br />iPod touch recognizes email addresses in different applications. If you run across an email address on a web page or a map listing, for example, just tap it; iPod touch opens a new message and addresses it for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Type Smart</strong><br />With its built-in dictionary, the intelligent iPod touch keyboard predicts and suggests words as you type, making it fast and easy to write email.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://app.ecwid.com/image/5649?ownerid=1003\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h6>Maps</h6>\n<p>When you're connected via Wi-Fi, you can get directions, find local businesses, and check traffic.</p>\n<p><strong>Find Yourself</strong><br />iPod touch finds your location using known Wi-Fi hotspots. It also finds points of interest by keyword: Search for \"coffee\" and iPod touch shows you every cafe nearby.</p>\n<p><strong>Get Directions</strong><br />Just type in an address and get directions from wherever you are. View a list of turn-by-turn directions, or see a highlighted map route. You also can mark specific locations and find the best route between them.</p>\n<p><strong>Enjoy the View</strong><br />Just like Google Maps on your computer, Maps on iPod touch lets you switch between views of Google map data, satellite images, and a hybrid of both. Multi-Touch makes the difference. Tap to zoom, pan, and change your view on the move.</p>\n<p><strong>See Traffic</strong><br />Maps on iPod touch shows you live traffic information, indicating traffic speed along your route in easy-to-read green, red, and yellow highlights.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://app.ecwid.com/image/5650?ownerid=1003\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h6>YouTube</h6>\n<p>Love to watch the latest YouTube videos? iPod touch gives you all the fun of the web's best videos--pocket-size.</p>\n<p><strong>Share from Anywhere</strong><br />Email your favorite videos to your favorite people. Tap \"Share\" on any YouTube video detail page, and iPod touch creates an email with the video link already in it.</p>\n<p><strong>Watch What You Want</strong><br />Explore Featured, Most Viewed, Most Recent, and Top Rated videos. Or search for the video you want with a keyword search. Once you find what you're looking for, bookmark it to watch later.</p>\n<h6>Photos</h6>\n<p>Carry up to 25,000 of your favorite photos everywhere.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://app.ecwid.com/image/5651?ownerid=1003\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Share Photos</strong><br />Show thousands of photos from the palm of your hand. Flick to scroll through thumbnails. Tap to view full screen. Rotate to see a photo in landscape. Pinch to zoom in or out. Play slideshows, complete with music and transitions. Email a photo to a friend, set it as your wallpaper, or share it in a MobileMe Gallery.</p>\n<p><strong>Save Photos</strong><br />If you receive a great image in an email, save it to your photo library on iPod touch. Once there, it acts just like any other photo. You can set it as your wallpaper, share it on the web, or pass it on.</p>\n<p><strong>Sync Photos</strong><br />iPod touch uses iTunes to sync photos you have in iPhoto on a Mac or Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Photoshop Album on a PC. Just choose which photos or albums to sync to your iPod touch, then you can look at them--and share them--anywhere you go.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://app.ecwid.com/image/5652?ownerid=1003\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h6>Calendar</h6>\n<p>With iPod touch, it's easy to make plans and stay on schedule.</p>\n<p><strong>Add Events</strong><br />Keep your schedule at your fingertips with iPod touch. Add events to your calendar. Set a custom alert. Write a note or two. Manage multiple color-coded calendars. And do it all with just a few taps.</p>\n<p><strong>Stay in Sync</strong><br />Connect iPod touch to your computer, and the events that you've created on-the-go automatically sync to Microsoft Outlook on a PC or iCal on a Mac. And all the events you've added on your computer sync to iPod touch.</p>\n<p><strong>Three Ways to View</strong><br />iPod touch gives you three ways to view your calendars. List view shows you all your appointments in the coming days as a comprehensive list, which you can scroll up and down. Day view displays one day's worth of appointments visually. And Month view offers an at-a-glance look at an entire month.</p>\n<h6>Contacts</h6>\n<p>Put names, email addresses, phone numbers, and more at your fingertips.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://app.ecwid.com/image/5653?ownerid=1003\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Make Contact</strong><br />Build your contacts list on your Mac with Address Book or on your PC with Microsoft Outlook, then sync everything to your iPod touch using iTunes. You also can add contact information directly to your iPod touch from maps, web pages, and email. Next time you sync, your computer is updated, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Search Contacts</strong><br />If you have a lot of contacts, a quick search shows you a list of matching names. Or you can scroll up and down your entire list to find the right contact. Want to send them an email? Just tap an email address and the Mail application opens automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>Organized by Groups</strong><br />If you keep your contacts organized into groups--such as co-workers, friends, family, and so on--iPod touch will, too. And iPod touch can hold more than just names, email addresses, and phone numbers. You also can track birthdays, websites, nicknames, and notes.</p>\n<h6>Stocks, Weather, and Notes</h6>\n<p>Stay on top of it all.</p>\n<p><strong>Check Stocks</strong><br />Stocks on iPod touch shows you performance information for any stock you choose. When you want more details about a stock's performance, tap the Y! for instant access to Yahoo! Finance.</p>\n<p><strong>Get Weather</strong><br />Check worldwide weather at home or away. Add the cities you want, then flick back and forth to get six-day forecasts for each. Tap the Y! to open a Yahoo! city guide that shows you what's happening, rain or shine.</p>\n<p><strong>Take Notes</strong><br />Forget the pen and paper. Use Notes on iPod touch to write yourself a quick note and keep important information on hand. There's even a built-in email function that lets you send notes to yourself or others.</p>\n<h6>Calculator</h6>\n<p>iPod touch's calculator helps you settle the restaurant bill or keep track of your budget.</p>\n<p><strong>Calculate Simply</strong><br />When you tap the Calculator icon, iPod touch shows you a simple application with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and memory functions. Use it just as you would a pocket calculator.</p>\n<p><strong>Calculate Scientifically</strong><br />Your simple calculator doubles as a sophisticated scientific calculator. Just rotate it to landscape to access dozens of functions for solving complex science and math problems.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://app.ecwid.com/image/5654?ownerid=1003\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h6>Nike + iPod</h6>\n<p>Get the most out of your workout.</p>\n<p><strong>Tune Your Run</strong><br />iPod touch now includes built-in Nike + iPod support. Just slip the Nike + iPod Sensor (available separately) into your Nike+ shoe and start your run. The sensor communicates wirelessly with your iPod touch, tracking your time, distance, and calories burned. It even gives you voice feedback on your progress.</p>\n<p><strong>Tune Your Cardio Workout</strong><br />This feature also works with new cardio equipment available in many fitness centers. Just look for treadmills, ellipticals, stair steppers, and stationary bikes that are Nike + iPod compatible.</p>\n<p><strong>Sync with Nikeplus.com</strong><br />When you get back to your computer, sync your iPod touch via iTunes and transfer your exercise data to nikeplus.com, where you can track your workouts, set goals, and challenge friends.</p>\n<h6>Multi-Touch</h6>\n<p>iPod touch features the same revolutionary interface as iPhone.</p>\n<p><strong>Glide, Flick, Pinch</strong><br />Built to take full advantage of the large 3.5-inch display, the Multi-Touch touchscreen interface lets you control everything using only your fingers. So you can glide through albums with Cover Flow, flick through photos and enlarge them with a pinch, zoom in and out on a section of a web page, and control game elements precisely.</p>\n<p><strong>How it Works</strong><br />The Multi-Touch display layers a protective shield over a capacitive panel that senses your touch using electrical fields. It then transmits that information to the LCD screen below it. iPod touch software enables the flick, tap, and pinch.</p>\n<p><strong>Type with the Touchscreen Keyboard</strong><br />iPod touch features an intelligent touchscreen keyboard perfect for browsing the web in Safari, getting directions on a map, searching for videos on YouTube, finding music on the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store, or adding new contacts. It analyzes keystrokes to suggest words as you type and correct spelling errors automatically. And because it's software based, it changes its keys to support typing in multiple languages.</p>\n<h6>Accelerometer</h6>\n<p>iPod touch responds to motion using a built-in accelerometer.</p>\n<p><strong>Responds to Movement</strong><br />iPod touch detects when you rotate it from portrait to landscape, then automatically changes the contents of the display. So you immediately see the entire width of a web page, view a photo in its proper aspect ratio, or control a game using only your movements.</p>\n<p><strong>How it Works</strong><br />The accelerometer inside iPod touch uses three elements: a silicon mass, a set of silicon springs, and an electrical current. The silicon springs measure the position of the silicon mass using the electrical current. Rotating iPod touch causes a fluctuation in the electrical current passing through the silicon springs. The accelerometer registers these fluctuations and tells iPod touch to adjust the display accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong>Perfect for Gaming</strong><br />Accelerometer technology really shines when you play games because it immerses you in the action. It's perfect for racing games--where your entire iPod touch acts as a steering wheel--and for tap-and-tilt games like Super Monkey Ball, in which your character responds to your every movement.</p>\n<h6>Wireless</h6>\n<p>Connect iPod touch to the Internet anywhere there's a wireless network.</p>\n<p><strong>Connect Automatically</strong><br />iPod touch locates nearby wireless hotspots, including protected networks. If you've never used a particular network, it asks you to enter a password the first time, and it remembers the password from then on. So the next time you're within range, it connects automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>Surf's Up</strong><br />Now you can send email from a coffee shop. Surf the web at the airport. Shop for games from your couch. Browse, buy, and download music from the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store at select Starbucks locations or other wireless hotspots in your area.</p>\n<h6>Read Kindle Books on the iPod touch</h6>\n<ul>\n<li>No Kindle required. </li>\n<li>Get the best reading experience available on your iPhone or iPod touch. </li>\n<li>No Kindle required. </li>\n<li>Access your Kindle books even if you don't have your Kindle with you. </li>\n<li>Automatically synchronizes your last page read between devices with Amazon Whispersync. </li>\n<li>Adjust the text size, add bookmarks, and view the annotations you created on your Kindle. </li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Shop for Books on the Kindle Store on Your iPod touch</h6>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy a book from the Kindle Store, optimized for Safari, on your iPod touch or iPhone and get it auto-delivered wirelessly. </li>\n<li>Search and browse more than 275,000 of your favorite photos everywhere.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://app.ecwid.com/image/5651?ownerid=1003\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Share Photos</strong><br />Show thousands of photos from the palm of your hand.

You also can add contact information directly to your iPod touch from maps, web pages, and email. Next time you sync, your computer is updated, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Search Contacts</strong><br />If you have a lot of contacts, a quick search shows you a list of matching names. Or you can scroll up and down your entire list to find the right contact. Want to send them an email?

With the multi-touch display, you can control everything using only your fingers. If you rotate your iPod touch from portrait to landscape, the accelerometer automatically changes the way the content is displayed. And with wireless technology, you can connect to the Internet from any Wi-Fi network, anywhere you are.</p>\n<p><strong>Multi-touch</strong><br />iPod touch features the same revolutionary interface as iPhone. Built to take full advantage of the large 3.5-inch display, the multi-touch interface lets you control everything using only your fingers. So you can glide through albums with Cover Flow, flick through photos and enlarge them with a pinch, or zoom in and out on a section of a web page. And iPod touch features a touchscreen QWERTY keyboard perfect for browsing the web in Safari, getting directions on a map, searching for videos on YouTube, finding music on the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store, or adding new contacts.</p>\n<p><strong>Ambient Light Sensor</strong><br />The iPod touch display has an ambient light sensor that automatically adjusts brightness to suit the ambient light in your surroundings. The result? A better experience for you and battery-saving efficiency for iPod touch.</p>\n<p><strong>Wireless</strong><br />Connect to the Internet anywhere there's a Wi-Fi network. Send email from a coffee shop. Surf the web at the airport. Browse, buy, and download music from the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store at select Starbucks locations or other wireless hot spots in your area. iPod touch finds wireless networks and connects you to the Internet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Accelerometer</strong><br />An accelerometer detects when you rotate iPod touch from portrait to landscape, then automatically changes the contents of the display, so you immediately see the entire width of a web page, your music in Cover Flow, or a photo in its proper aspect ratio.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://app.ecwid.com/image/5629?ownerid=1003\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n<h6>Read Kindle Books on the iPod touch</h6>\n<ul>\n<li>No Kindle required. </li>\n<li>Get the best reading experience available on your iPhone or iPod touch. </li>\n<li>No Kindle required. </li>\n<li>Access your Kindle books even if you don't have your Kindle with you. </li>\n<li>Automatically synchronizes your last page read between devices with Amazon Whispersync. </li>\n<li>Adjust the text size, add bookmarks, and view the annotations you created on your Kindle. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Shop for Books on the Kindle Store on Your iPod touch</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy a book from the Kindle Store, optimized for Safari, on your iPod touch or iPhone and get it auto-delivered wirelessly. </li>\n<li>Search and browse more than 275,000 books, including more than 107 of 112 <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers. </li>\n<li>Find <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers and new releases for $9.99, unless marked otherwise. </li>\n<li>Get free book samples; read the first chapter for free before you decide to buy. </li>\n<li>Books you purchase also can be read on a Kindle. </li>\n<li>Kindle newspapers, magazines, and blogs are not currently available on the iPod touch or iPhone.</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>What's in the Box</h6>\n<p><br />8 GB iPod touch, earphones, USB 2.0 cable, dock adapter, polishing cloth, stand, quick start guide.</p>\n<div style=\"display: block; padding: 24px 24px 24px 21px; background-color: #ececec;\">This site is a demo site only.

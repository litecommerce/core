U.S.P.S. module
================

This module gets real-time shipping quotes for USPS shipping methods via the
USPS WebTools API.

Configuring
------------

When the module is installed, click on the 'Settings' link by the module name
on the Addons page or select "Shipping & Settings" -> "Shipping" -> "U.S.P.S.
settings" on the menu.

Be sure to specify a value in the "User ID" field. You can get a User ID
directly on the USPS website at https://secure.shippingapis.com/registration/
Specify the "U.S.P.S. API server" value using the the link provided in the
e-mail notification received from USPS.

After a User ID is supplied, the 'Test U.S.P.S. rates calculation' form appears
under the 'U.S.P.S. settings' form, where you can specify source and
destination country, ZIP code, package weight and order subtotal and test how
the rates work. Clicking the 'Calculate rates' button opens a new browser
window (tab) with transaction details, such as input data array, list of
shipping methods with rates returned by the USPS server (or error message) and
communication log (XML request and response and request URL).

You can modify the USPS module settings to get the module work the way you
need.

Also, you can make certain shipping methods returned by USPS hidden or
available to customers at checkout - adjust this in the Shipping methods
section.

Note: The company location country must be United States, a ZIP code must be
specified (menu: Settings -> General settings -> Company options); otherwise,
the module will not show any rates at the storefront.

Note: If USPS returns an error like 'API Authorization failure. RateV4 is not a
valid API name for this protocol.', there may be 2 reasons for it. First, you
may have specified wrong credentials in the "User ID" and/or "U.S.P.S. API
server" fields. Or, your account might not support API RateV4 and IntlRateV2.
If it.s the second case, contact the USPS support team and ask them to give
your account the production status (test accounts may not support these APIs).

Special notes
--------------

1. USPS rates are very sensitive to the module settings. Be sure you know what
you are doing when adjusting those settings. Test them carefully in the
administrator interface before letting customers use it.

2. If USPS rates do not appear at the checkout or estimate shipping popup,
enable the debug option (set the 'level' option under the [log_details] section
to PEAR_LOG_DEBUG value in <litecommerce-dir>/etc/config.php file) and see the
log in <litecommerce-dir>/var/log/xlite.log.YYYY-MM-DD.php

3. If the USPS API returns a rate for methods that are not in the LiteCommerce
database (e.g. if USPS has added a new method), those methods will be inserted
to the database with the disabled status. You can enable them, and the methods
will be available to your customers at the checkout.
